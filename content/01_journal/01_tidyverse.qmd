## Load libraries

Library Tidyverse is used for the shaping and Warngling data properly.

Library lubridate is used to process the dates in data file properly.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Import Files

one can find the data tabel in <https://www.startupengineer.io/_repos/_transfer/data_science/02_intro_tv/#business-case-i-classfas-fa-user-tiei-nbsp>

## Examine the data

glimpse() function is used to examine the data that should be processed.

```{r}
1 + 1
```
## Joining Data

orderlines_tbl is left joined with bikes_tbl, on product id and bike id is equal and again it was left joined with bikeshops_tbl on customer id equal to bikeshop id. The results are put in bike_orderlines_joined_tbl.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Wrangling Data

column location is devided into two column: 1.City 2. state.
total price is calculated and added to the table using mutate() function.
select() function is used remove remove unnecessary columns(Ex: gender).
Columns are reordered using select().
One column name is changed, other formatting name is done.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Business Insights

Necessary column is selected for the insights, then grouped by state. Total price is calculated using summerize()& sum() function.
Total Price data formatted into Euro.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

### Sales by state

Sales by state table is visulized using ggplot(), Geometrics, Formatting and Labs.

```
To save resulted file as CSV file:
```{r}
bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl %>%
  write_xlsx("00_data/01_bike_sales/02_wragled_data_tidy_ch/bike_orderlines.csv")
```
To save resulted file as RDS file:
